> Aapki Dukaan is a place to sell anything online, but this time, this place is yours, its aapki dukaan.
> 

**Basic Idea** - Aapki dukaan is an online e-commerce website-making tool that offers all the features of a modern CMS dedicated to e-commerce but there is a twist. It is designed to be user-friendly to small shop owners. They can create a website for free and pay monthly bills as per the sales recorder per month on a commission basis.

When big players came into the e-commerce market, Retail shop owners had a hard it, after corona, they went into bigger trouble as people started ordering basic things online. Thus, through aapki dukaan they can sell their products online to their own audience through their own website.

For example, if Ajey is a shop owner of Shakti Enterprises, then he can simply create a website in a few clicks on our website and he can sell his products from

shaktienterprises.aapkidukaan.com

**How are we different from existing solutions?** 

Although all other e-commerce sites also let users buy from these sellers but they come with a lot of disadvantages such as -

1. High charges for setup are usually above a lakh.
2. Low Margin
3. Competition among sellers. 
4. Difficult to manage for a small shop owner.

While what we are giving them is their own website for free, with multiple features such as -

1. Sales Records & Order Management.
2. Very Low commission based on the category of products.
3. Various templates to choose from.
4. Features of a modern E-commerce website such as 
    1. Promo Codes & Discount Offers
    2. COD/ Online Payment
    3. Marking Products as Unavailable/ Out Of Stock.
    4. SMS alerts for order's received.
    5. Dedicated Executive for helping them out in adding products & managing inventory.
    
    & all these features come in a dedicated admin panel that can be easily used
    
    **How are we Different from other Website Builders and Similar solutions**
    
    Our marketing and pricing strategy is completely unique.
    
    While other solutions take a one-time fee or a starting fee, we do not take any fee from our clients but will generate an automated bill at the end of every 30 days.
    
    The bill amount is the total commission that we are taking in which the commission is based on 5% of total Sales
    
    Thus, clients will only pay for the profits, thus small-scale businesses will be most attracted by our pricing scheme and in Indian markets, this pricing will prove to be efficient as we make money when they make money.
    
    While our marketing strategy is completely unique in which we are mixing the concept of digital marketing, door-to-door marketing, and affiliate marketing.
    
    Anyone eligible can apply for an executive account on our website with which they can register any shop on our website and they will be recorded as a dedicated executive to the particular client and then on every bill the client will pay from then onwards, a fixed commission will go to the executive, in turn of which executive has to help the client in setting up products and giving them a demo of our product.
    
    This model is basically an affiliate marketing model which can be executed easily from home by targeting small businesses that are active on social media and do not have a proper website or by going door to door to shop nearby.
    
    This will generate a lot of passive income for executives and each month they have to add 3 more clients to the website.
    
     **Why our idea can be successful**
    
    Even after providing the website for free, we do not have to spend anything on marketing, because the executives will reach our target clients and then they will promote their websites themselves as we will provide them with scanners that they can put in front of their shops that redirect customers to their website. Social media businesses can put the website link in their Bio and promote it. They will market their website because it's their own. It's Aapki Dukaan.
